## Assignments / to-dos

### Week 1

- (Required) By Friday August 26 at noon, fill out [this class survey](https://forms.gle/SVm9thpkh16Zps2h6) This is required and will be 'counted' in the class participation portion of your grade.

- (Required) By Friday August 26 at noon, fill out [this survey of potential office hour times](http://whenisgood.net/jxstc5k).

- (Optional) By Friday August 26 at noon, ONLY if you would like to attend the optional R help session, fill out [this survey of potential times for the extra R help session](TBD)

- (Required) By Monday August 29, please read Sections 1-3 of Unit 2, as I'll just touch on an item or two from those sections in class and will assume you're familiar with getting CSV-formatted and similar data into and out of R and some of the pitfalls that can arise. 

- (Optional) By Monday August 29, if you are not comfortable with the basic UNIX usage we saw in the first class, please work through the [UNIX basics tutorial here](https://berkeley-scf.github.com/tutorial-unix-basics) and answer the questions at the end. You don't need to turn anything in. If you'd think you're going to like help, please come to the UNIX help session on Friday August 26.

### Weeks 2-3

- (Optional) If you are not familiar with R at the level of [modules
1-5 of the R bootcamp](https://berkeley-scf.github.com/berkeley-scf/r-bootcamp-fall-2022/schedule),
work through those modules and the breakout problems associated with
the modules. If you'd like help and an opportunity for extra practice,
please attend the special R catch-up session listed below. Some other
resources for R are listed at the end of module 11 of the bootcamp
materials, so you could also use those resources. You should do this by the end of the week of September 6.

- (Required) By Friday September 2 at 10 am, read through this [tutorial on using the bash shell](https://berkeley-scf.github.com/tutorial-using-bash). See the notes in Unit 3 on what topics you can skip; in particular you can skip the pages on Regular Expressions and Managing Processes. Work through the first 10 problems in the [exercises](https://berkeley-scf.github.io/tutorial-using-bash/exercises) the end of the tutorial and [submit answers via bCourses (under Assignments)](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1517800/assignments) as text copied into bCourses. This is not a formal problem set, so you don't need to worry about formatting nor about explaining/commenting your answers, nor do you need to put your answers in your GitHub class repository. In fact it's even fine with me if you hand-write the answers and scan them to an electronic document. I just want to make sure you've worked through the tutorial. 
   - You don't need to look at all the sections in the tutorial. Please see Section 2 of Unit 3 in the course repository for a list of the sections you can skip over. I'll be doing demonstrations on using the bash shell in class on Wednesday August 31, so that will be helpful as you work through the tutorial. 

- (Required) Problem Set (PS) 1 will be due Wednesday September 7 at 10 am.

- (Required) By Friday September 10 at 10 am, read the regular expression material in the [tutorial on using the bash shell](https://berkeley-scf.github.io/tutorial-using-bash/regex). Also read Section 2.1 of the [string processing tutorial](https://berkeley-scf.github.io/tutorial-string-processing) (you can focus on Section 2.1.2 on stringr if you wish). Then answer the regular expressions (regex) practice problems at [this Google form](TBD). This is not one of the graded problem sets but rather an 'assignment' that will simply be noted as being completed or not.


## Events

- (Optional) Thursday August 25 or Wednesday September 7, 4-5:30 pm: [introductory LaTeX sessions](https://berkeley.libcal.com/calendar/workshops) run by the library. In particular I highly recommend (in particular if you are a Statistics graduate student) that you know how to create equations in LaTeX.

- (Optional) Friday August 26, 1:00-4:30 pm in Evans 344: Help session for installing software, accessing a UNIX-style command line, and basic UNIX usage (e.g., the UNIX basics tutorial). You should have software installed, be able to accesss the command line, and have started to become familiar with basic UNIX usage before class on Wednesday August 31.

- (Optional) TBD: two-hour R help session, date/time/location TBD, for those not yet familiar with R at the level of modules 1-5 of the [R bootcamp](https://berkeley-scf.github.com/berkeley-scf/r-bootcamp-fall-2022/schedule).

- (Required) Friday September 2: First section/lab on using Git, setting up your GitHub repository for problem sets, and using R Markdown/knitr to generate dynamic documents. Please come only to the section you are registered for given space limits in the room, unless you have talked with Chris and have his permission. 

- (Required) Friday September 9: Second section/lab on assertions and testing. Please come only to the section you are registered for given space limits in the room, unless you have talked with Chris and have his permission.
