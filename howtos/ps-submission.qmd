We are trying something different this year - instead of everyone creating individual 
repositories at github.com, we are creating repositories for everyone at https://github.berkeley.edu/.
Additionally, homeworks still need to be submitted as PDFs on Gradescope.

Steps:

1. Accounts are being initialized, everyone needs to log into https://github.berkeley.edu/
using their berkeley credentials. Because of how the system works, accounts can 
be initiated, but to be created each student must log in first.
Nothing else needs to be done, just log in and log out.

2. After accounts are created (may take a couple days after first login), when 
you log-in again, you should see one private repository listed on the left side 
(mine reads `stat243-fall-2021/ahv36`). This is your class repository.
Do not change the repository settings! They are set up for this class.

3. Clone the repo to your home directory (I would clone it into a directory
just for repositories (e.g., I use `~/repos`). In the top-level of your working
directory, you should create a file named (exactly)`.gitignore` 
without the quotes. 

The .gitignore file causes Git to ignore transient or computer-specific files that R/RStudio generates.
(more info at https://github.com/github/gitignore)
In it, put (again, don't put dashed lines):

-------------------------
# History files
.Rhistory
.Rapp.history

# Session Data files
.RData

# Example code in package build process
*-Ex.R

# Output files from R CMD build
/*.tar.gz

# Output files from R CMD check
/*.Rcheck/

# RStudio files
.Rproj.user/

# produced vignettes
vignettes/*.html
vignettes/*.pdf

# OAuth2 token, see https://github.com/hadley/httr/releases/tag/v0.3
.httr-oauth

# knitr and R markdown default cache directories

/cache/

# Temporary files created by R markdown
*.utf8.md
*.knit.md

Repository Organization
The problem sets in your repository should be organized into folders with specific filenames.  
When we pull from your repository, our code will be assuming the following structure:

your_repo/
├── ps1/
│   ├── ps1.pdf
│   ├── ps1.Rmd (.Rtex, .rnw, .lyx, .tex, .R)
├── ps2/
│   ├── ...
├── ...
├── ps8/
├── .gitignore
└── info.json


The file names are case-sensitive, so please keep everything lowercase.
