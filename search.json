    "text": "By UNIX, I mean any UNIX-like operating system, including Linux and Mac OS X. On the Mac you can access a UNIX terminal window with the Terminal application (via Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal from the Finder). Most modern scientific computing is done on UNIX-based machines, often by remotely logging in to a UNIX-based server.\nThere are a variety of ways to get access to a UNIX-style command line environment, outlined in the software tips on the course website."

(Note: RStudio as a whole is an IDE (integrated development environment. The editor is just the editing window where you edit code (and R Markdown) files.)\nVSCode has a powerful code editor that is customized to work with various languages.\n\nAs you get started it’s ok to use a very simple text editor such as Notepad in Windows, but you should take the time in the next few weeks to try out more powerful editors such as one of those listed above. It will be well worth your time over the course of your graduate work and then your career.\nBe careful in Windows - file suffixes are often hidden."
