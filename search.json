    "text": "Text and binary files\nIn general, files can be divided into text files and binary files. In both cases, information is stored as a series of bits. Recall that a bit is a single value in base 2 (i.e., a 0 or a 1), while a byte is 8 bits.\nA text file is one in which the bits in the file encode individual characters. Note that the characters can include the digit characters 0-9, so one can include numbers in a text file by writing down the digits needed for the number of interest. Examples of text file formats include CSV, XML, HTML, and JSON.\nText files may be simple ASCII files (i.e., files encoded using ASCII) or in other encodings such as UTF-8, both covered in Section 4. ASCII files have 8 bits (1 byte) per character and can represent 128 characters (the 52 lower and upper case letters in English, 10 digits, punctuation and a few other things – basically what you see on a standard US keyboard). UTF-8 files have between 1 and 4 bytes per character.\nA binary file is one in which the bits in the file encode the information in a custom format and not simply individual characters. Binary formats are not (easily) human readable but can be more space-efficient and faster to work with (because it can allow random access into the data rather than requiring sequential reading). The meaning of the bytes in such files depends on the specific binary format being used and a program that uses the file needs to know how the format represents information. Examples of binary files include netCDF files, R data (e.g., .Rda) files, and compiled code files.\nNumbers in binary files are usually stored as 8 bytes per number. We’ll discuss this much more in Unit 6."

    "title": "Unit 2: Data Technologies",
    "section": "Common file types",
    "text": "Common file types\nHere are some of the common file types. Any of these types can be categorized as text or binary.\n\n‘Flat’ text files: data are often provided as simple text files. Often one has one record or observation per row and each column or field is a different variable or type of information about the record. Such files can either have a fixed number of characters in each field (fixed width format) or a special character (a delimiter) that separates the fields in each row. Common delimiters are tabs, commas, one or more spaces, and the pipe (|). Common file extensions are .txt and .csv. Metadata (information about the data) are often stored in a separate file. CSV files are quite common, but if you have files where the data contain commas, other delimiters can be good. Text can be put in quotes in CSV files, and this can allow use of commas within the data. This is difficult to deal with in bash, but read.table() in R handles this situation.\n\nOne occasionally tricky difficulty is as follows. If you have a text file created in Windows, the line endings are coded differently than in UNIX (a newline (the ASCII character \\n) and a carriage return (the ASCII character \\r) in Windows vs. only a newline in UNIX). There are UNIX utilities (fromdos in Ubuntu, including the SCF Linux machines and dos2unix in other Linux distributions) that can do the necessary conversion. If you see ^M at the end of the lines in a file, that’s the tool you need. Alternatively, if you open a UNIX file in Windows, it may treat all the lines as a single line. You can fix this with todos or unix2dos.\n\nIn some contexts, such as textual data and bioinformatics data, the data may in a text file with one piece of information per row, but without meaningful columns/fields.\nIn scientific contexts, netCDF (.nc) (and the related HDF5) are popular format for gridded data that allows for highly-efficient storage and contains the metadata within the file. The basic structure of a netCDF file is that each variable is an array with multiple dimensions (e.g., latitude, longitude, and time), and one can also extract the values of and metadata about each dimension. The ncdf4 package in R nicely handles working with netCDF files.\nData may also be in text files in formats designed for data interchange between various languages, in particular XML or JSON. These formats are “self-describing”; namely the metadata is part of the file. The XML2, rvest, and jsonlite packages are useful for reading and writing from these formats.\nYou may be scraping information on the web, so dealing with text files in various formats, including HTML. The XML2 and rvest packages are also useful for reading HTML.\nData may already be in a database or in the data storage of another statistical package (Stata, SAS, SPSS, etc.). The foreign package in R has excellent capabilities for importing Stata (read.dta()), SPSS (read.spss()), and SAS (read.ssd() and, for XPORT files, read.xport()), among others.\nFor Excel, there are capabilities to read an Excel file (see the readxl and XLConnect package among others), but you can also just go into Excel and export as a CSV file or the like and then read that into R. In general, it’s best not to pass around data files as Excel or other spreadsheet format files because (1) Excel is proprietary, so someone may not have Excel and the format is subject to change, (2) Excel imposes limits on the number of rows, (3) one can easily manipulate text files such as CSV using UNIX tools, but this is not possible with an Excel file, (4) Excel files often have more than one sheet, graphs, macros, etc., so they’re not a data storage format per se.\nR can easily interact with databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, etc.), querying the database using SQL and returning results to R. More in the big data unit and in the large datasets tutorial mentioned above."

    "title": "Unit 2: Data Technologies",
    "section": "Core R functions",
    "text": "Core R functions\nread.table() is probably the most commonly-used function for reading in data. It reads in delimited files (read.csv() and read.delim() are special cases of read.table()). The key arguments are the delimiter (the sep argument) and whether the file contains a header, a line with the variable names. We can use read.fwf() to read from a fixed width text file into a data frame.\nThe most difficult part of reading in such files can be dealing with how R determines the classes of the fields that are read in. There are a number of arguments to read.table() and read.fwf() that allow the user to control the classes. One difficulty in older versions of R was that character fields were read in as factors.\nLet’s work through a couple examples. Before we do that, let’s look at the arguments to read.table(). Note that sep=“ separates on any amount of white space. In the code chunk below, I’ve told knitr not to print the output to the PDF; you can see the full output by running the code yourself.\n\ndat <- read.table(file.path('..', 'data', 'RTADataSub.csv'),\n                  sep = ',', header = TRUE)\nsapply(dat, class)\n## whoops, there is an 'x', presumably indicating missingness:\nunique(dat[ , 2])\n## let's treat 'x' as a missing value indicator\ndat2 <- read.table(file.path('..', 'data', 'RTADataSub.csv'),\n                   sep = ',', header = TRUE,\n                   na.strings = c(\"NA\", \"x\"))\nunique(dat2[ ,2])\n## hmmm, what happened to the blank values this time?\nwhich(dat[ ,2] == \"\")\ndat2[which(dat[, 2] == \"\")[1], ] # pull out a line with a missing string\n\n# using 'colClasses'\nsequ <- read.table(file.path('..', 'data', 'hivSequ.csv'),\n  sep = ',', header = TRUE,\n  colClasses = c('integer','integer','character',\n    'character','numeric','integer'))\n## let's make sure the coercion worked - sometimes R is obstinant\nsapply(sequ, class)\n## that made use of the fact that a data frame is a list\n\nNote that you can avoid reading in one or more columns by specifying NULL as the column class for those columns to be omitted. Also, specifying the colClasses argument explicitly should make for faster file reading. Finally, setting stringsAsFactors=FALSE is standard practice and is the default in R as of version 4.0. (readr::read_csv() has always set stringsAsFactors=FALSE.\nIf possible, it’s a good idea to look through the input file in the shell or in an editor before reading into R to catch such issues in advance. Using less on RTADataSub.csv would have revealed these various issues, but note that RTADataSub.csv is a 1000-line subset of a much larger file of data available from the kaggle.com website. So more sophisticated use of UNIX utilities as we saw in Unit 2 is often useful before trying to read something into R.\nThe basic function scan() simply reads everything in, ignoring lines, which works well and very quickly if you are reading in a numeric vector or matrix. scan() is also useful if your file is free format - i.e., if it’s not one line per observation, but just all the data one value after another; in this case you can use scan() to read it in and then format the resulting character or numeric vector as a matrix with as many columns as fields in the dataset. Remember that the default is to fill the matrix by column.\nIf the file is not nicely arranged by field (e.g., if it has ragged lines), we’ll need to do some more work. readLines() will read in each line into a separate character vector, after which we can process the lines using text manipulation. Here’s an example from some US meteorological data where I know from metadata (not provided here) that the 4-11th values are an identifier, the 17-20th are the year, the 22-23rd the month, etc.\nActually, that file, precip.txt, is in a fixed-width format (i.e., every element in a given column has the exact same number of characters),so reading in using read.fwf() would be a good strategy.\nR allows you to read in not just from a file but from a more general construct called a connection. Here are some examples of connections:\n\nreadLines(pipe(\"ls -al\"))\n\n[1] \"total 64\"                                                         \n[2] \"drwxr-sr-x 2 paciorek scfstaff     8 Aug 12 10:56 .\"              \n[3] \"drwxr-sr-x 5 paciorek scfstaff    12 Aug 12 10:49 ..\"             \n[4] \"-rw-r--r-- 1 paciorek scfstaff 10177 Aug 12 10:13 unit1.Rmd\"      \n[5] \"-rw-r--r-- 1 paciorek scfstaff    48 Aug 12 10:49 unit2.R\"        \n[6] \"-rw-r--r-- 1 paciorek scfstaff    55 Aug 12 10:20 unit2.R~\"       \n[7] \"-rw-r--r-- 1 paciorek scfstaff 12791 Aug 12 10:56 unit2.rmarkdown\"\n[8] \"-rw-r--r-- 1 paciorek scfstaff 12785 Aug 12 10:56 unit2.Rmd\"      \n[9] \"-rw-r--r-- 1 paciorek scfstaff 12797 Aug 12 10:30 unit2.Rmd~\"     \n\n\nIn some cases, you might need to create the connection using url() or using the curl() function from the curl package. Though for the example here, simply passing the URL to readLines() does work. (In general, curl::curl() provides some nice features for reading off the internet.)\nIf a file is large, we may want to read it in in chunks (of lines), do some computations to reduce the size of things, and iterate. read.table(), read.fwf() and readLines() all have the arguments that let you read in a fixed number of lines. To read-on-the-fly in blocks, we need to first establish the connection and then read from it sequentially. (If you don’t, you’ll read from the start of the file every time you read from the file.)"

Programming concepts will include data and text manipulation, data structures, functions and variable scope, regular expressions, debugging/testing, and parallel processing. Statistical computing topics will include working with large datasets, numerical linear algebra, computer arithmetic/precision, simulation studies and Monte Carlo methods, numerical optimization, and numerical integration/differentiation. A goal is that coverage of these topics complement the models/methods discussed in the rest of the statistics/biostatistics graduate curriculum. We will also cover the basics of UNIX/Linux, in particular some basic shell scripting and operating on remote servers, as well as a moderate amount of Python.\n\n\nWhile the course is taught using R and you will learn a lot about using R at an advanced level, the focus of the course is computing for statistics and data science more generally. Also, this is not a course that will cover specific statistical/machine learning/data analysis methods.\n\n\n\nInformal prerequisites: If you are not a statistics or biostatistics graduate student, please chat with me if you’re not sure if this course makes sense for you. A background in calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics is expected, as well as a basic ability to operate on a computer (but I do not assume familiarity with the UNIX-style command line/terminal/shell). Furthermore, I’m expecting you will know the basics of R, at the level of the Modules 1-5 in the R bootcamp offered Aug. 20-21, 2022. If you don’t have that background you’ll need to spend time in the initial couple weeks getting up to speed. All the material from the bootcamp is available here (plus I can give you access to the bootcamp videos), we’ll have an optional hands-on practice session during the second or third week of class, and the GSI can also provide assistance."

By and large, these will only last for about one hour of actual content, but the second hour may be used as an office hour with the GSI or for troubleshooting software during the early weeks. The discussion sections will vary in format and topic, but material will include demonstrations on various topics (version control, debugging, testing, etc.), group work on these topics, discussion of relevant papers, and discussion of problem set solutions. The first section (noon - 2 pm) generally has more demand, so to avoid having too many people in the room, you should go to your assigned section unless you talk to me first."

I encourage you to ask questions and will pose questions to the class to think about, respond to via Google forms, and discuss. To increase time for discussion and assimilation of the material in class, before some classes I may ask that you read material or work through tutorials in advance of class. Occasionally, I will ask you to submit answers to questions in advance of class as well.\nPlease do not use phones during class and limit laptop use to the material being covered.\nStudent backgrounds with computing will vary. For those of you with limited background on a topic, I encourage you to ask questions during class so I know what you find confusing. For those of you with extensive background on a topic (there will invariably be some topics where one of you will know more about it than I do or have more real-world experience), I encourage you to pitch in with your perspective. In general, there are many ways to do things on a computer, particularly in a UNIX environment and in R, so it will help everyone (including me) if we hear multiple perspectives/ideas.\nFinally, class recordings for review or to make up for absence will be available through the bCourses Media Gallery, available on the Media Gallery tab on the bCourses page for the class."

    "text": "Course requirements and grading\n\nScheduling Conflicts\nCampus asks that I include this information about conflicts: Please notify me in writing by the second week of the term about any known or potential extracurricular conflicts (such as religious observances, graduate or medical school interviews, or team activities). I will try my best to help you with making accommodations, but I cannot promise them in all cases. In the event there is no mutually-workable solution, you may be dropped from the class.\nThe main conflict that would be a problem would be the quizzes, whose dates I will determine in late August / early September.\nQuizzes are in-person. There is no remote option, and the only make-up accommodations I will make are for illness or serious personal issues. Do not schedule any travel that may conflict with a quiz.\n\n\nCourse grades\nThe grade for this course is primarily based on assignments due every 1-2 weeks, two quizzes (likely in early-mid October and mid-late November), and a final group project. I will also provide extra credit questions on some problem sets. There is no final exam. 50% of the grade is based on the problem sets, 25% on the quizzes, 15% on the project, and 10% on your participation in discussions on Ed, your responses to the in-class Google forms questions, as well as occasional brief questions that I will ask you to answer in advance of the next class.\nGrades will generally be As and Bs. An A involves doing all the work, getting full credit on most of the problem sets, showing competence on the quizzes, and doing a thorough job on the final project.\n\n\nProblem sets\nWe will be less willing to help you if you come to our office hours or post a question online at the last minute. Working with computers can be unpredictable, so give yourself plenty of time for the assignments.\nThere are several rules for submitting your assignments.\n\nYou should prepare your assignments using either R Markdown (or the new Quarto format) or LaTeX plus knitr.\nProblem set submission consists of both of the following:\n\nA PDF submitted electronically through Gradescope, by the start of class (10 am) on the due date, and\nAn electronic copy of the PDF, code file, and R Markdown/Quarto/knitr document pushed to your class GitHub repository, following the instructions to be provided by the GSI.\n\nOn-time submission will be determined based on the time stamp of when the PDF is submitted to Gradescope.\nAnswers should consist of textual response or mathematical expressions as appropriate, with key chunks of code embedded within the document. Extensive additional code can be provided as an appendix. Before diving into the code for a problem, you should say what the goal of the code is and your strategy for solving the problem. Raw code without explanation is not an appropriate solution. Please see our qualitative grading rubric for guidance. In general the rubric is meant to reinforce good coding practices and high-quality scientific communication.\nAny mathematical derivations may be done by hand and scanned with your phone if you prefer that to writing up LaTeX equations.\n\nNote: R Markdown is an extension to the Markdown markup language that allows one to embed R code within an HTML document. Quarto is a new tool that generalizes R Markdown and provides the compatible qmd format. knitr is a tool that allows one to embed chunks of code within LaTeX documents, including with Overleaf and the LyX GUI front-end to LaTeX. Please see the SCF dynamics document tutorial; there will be additional information in the first section and on the first problem set.\n\n\nSubmitting assignments\nIn the first section (September 2), we’ll discuss how to submit your problem sets both on Gradescope and via your class GitHub repository, located at https:github.berkeley.edu/<your_calnet_username>.\n\n\nProblem set grading\nThe grading scheme for problem sets is as follows. Each problem set will receive a numeric score for (1) presentation and explanation of results, (2) technical accuracy of code or mathematical derivation, and (3) code quality/style and creativity. For each of these three components, the possible scores are:\n\n0 = no credit,\n1 = partial credit (you did some of the problems but not all),\n2 = satisfactory (you tried everything but there were pieces of what you did that didn’t solve or present/explain one or more problems in a complete way), and\n3 = full credit.\n\nAgain, the qualitative grading rubric provides guidance on what we want to see for full credit.\nFor components #1 and #3, many of you will get a score of 2 for some problem sets as you develop good coding practices. You can still get an A in the class despite this.\nYour total score for the PS is a weighted sum of the scores for the three components. If you turn in a PS late, I’ll bump you down by two points (out of the available). If you turn it in really late (i.e., after we start grading them), I will bump you down by four points. No credit after solutions are distributed.\n\n\nFinal project\nThe final project will be a joint coding project in groups of 3-4. I’ll assign an overall task, and you’ll be responsible for dividing up the work, coding, debugging, testing, and documentation. You’ll need to use the Git version control system for working in your group.\n\n\nRules for working together and the campus honor code\nI encourage you to work together and help each other out. However, the problem set solutions you submit must be your own. What do I mean by that?\n\nYou must first try to figure out a given problem on your own. After that, if you’re stuck or want to explore alternative approaches or check what you’ve done, feel free to consult with your fellow students and with the GSI and me.\nWhat does “consult with a fellow student mean”? You can discuss a problem with another student, brainstorm approaches, and share code syntax (generally not more than one line) on how to do small individual coding tasks within a problem.\n\nYou should not ask another student for complete code or solutions, or look at their code/solution.\nYou should not share complete code or solutions with another student or on Ed Discussion.\n\nYou must provide attribution for ideas obtained elsewhere, including other students.\n\nIf you got a specific idea for how to do part of a problem from a fellow student, you should note that in your solution in the appropriate place (for specific syntax ideas, note this in a code comment), just as you would cite a book or URL.\nYou MUST note on your problem set solution any fellow students who you worked/consulted with.\nYou do not need to cite any Ed Discussion posts nor any discussions with Chris or James.\n\nUltimately, your solution to a problem set (writeup and code) must be your own, and you’ll hear from me if either look too similar to someone else’s.\n\nPlease see the last section of this document for more information on the Campus Honor Code, which I expect you to follow."

With regard to collaboration and independence, please see my rules regarding problem sets above – Chris.\nThe student community at UC Berkeley has adopted the following Honor Code: “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” The hope and expectation is that you will adhere to this code.\nCollaboration and Independence: Reviewing lecture and reading materials and studying for exams can be enjoyable and enriching things to do with fellow students. This is recommended. However, unless otherwise instructed, homework assignments are to be completed independently and materials submitted as homework should be the result of one’s own independent work.\nCheating: A good lifetime strategy is always to act in such a way that no one would ever imagine that you would even consider cheating. Anyone caught cheating on a quiz or exam in this course will receive a failing grade in the course and will also be reported to the University Center for Student Conduct. In order to guarantee that you are not suspected of cheating, please keep your eyes on your own materials and do not converse with others during the quizzes and exams.\nPlagiarism: To copy text or ideas from another source without appropriate reference is plagiarism and will result in a failing grade for your assignment and usually further disciplinary action. For additional information on plagiarism and how to avoid it, see, for example: http://gsi.berkeley.edu/teachingguide/misconduct/prevent-plag.html\nAcademic Integrity and Ethics: Cheating on exams and plagiarism are two common examples of dishonest, unethical behavior. Honesty and integrity are of great importance in all facets of life. They help to build a sense of self-confidence, and are key to building trust within relationships, whether personal or professional. There is no tolerance for dishonesty in the academic world, for it undermines what we are dedicated to doing – furthering knowledge for the benefit of humanity.\nYour experience as a student at UC Berkeley is hopefully fueled by passion for learning and replete with fulfilling activities. And we also appreciate that being a student may be stressful. There may be times when there is temptation to engage in some kind of cheating in order to improve a grade or otherwise advance your career. This could be as blatant as having someone else sit for you in an exam, or submitting a written assignment that has been copied from another source. And it could be as subtle as glancing at a fellow student’s exam when you are unsure of an answer to a question and are looking for some confirmation. One might do any of these things and potentially not get caught. However, if you cheat, no matter how much you may have learned in this class, you have failed to learn perhaps the most important lesson of all."
