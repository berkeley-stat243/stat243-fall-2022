Your GitHub submission should include the Rmd/qmd/Rtex file, any R code files containing chunks that you read into your Rmd/qmd/Rtex file, and the final PDF, all named according to the submission guidelines.\nYour solution should not just be code - you should have text describing how you approached the problem and what the various steps were. Your code should have comments indicating what each function or block of code does, and for any lines of code or code constructs that may be hard to understand, a comment indicating what that code does. You do not need to (and should not) show exhaustive output, but in general you should show short examples of what your code does to demonstrate its functionality. Please see the grading rubric."

    "text": "Problems\n\nPlease read these lecture notes about how computers work, used in a class on statistical computing at CMU. In particular, make sure you know the difference between disk and memory. You don’t need to turn anything in for this problem.\nThis problem explores file sizes in light of understanding storage in ASCII plain text versus binary formats and the fact that numbers are (generally) stored as 8 bytes per number in binary format.\n\nExplain the sizes of the two files created below. In discussing the CSV text file, how many characters do you expect to be in the file (i.e., you should be able to estimate this very accurately from first principles without using wc or any explicit program that counts characters). Hint: what do we know about numbers drawn from a standard normal distribution?\n\nn <-  1e7\na <- matrix(rnorm(n), ncol = 100)\na <- round(a, 10)\n\nfn_csv <- tempfile(fileext = 'csv')\nwrite.table(a, file = fn_csv, quote=FALSE, row.names=FALSE,\n               col.names = FALSE, sep=',')\nfn_rda <- tempfile(fileext = 'Rda')\nsave(a, file = fn_rda, compress = FALSE)\n\nfile.size(fn_csv)\n\n[1] 133889265\n\nfile.size(fn_rda)\n\n[1] 80000096\n\n\nNow consider saving out the numbers one row per number. Given we no longer have to save all the commas, why is the file size unchanged?\n\nb <- a\ndim(b) <- c(1e7, 1)  ## change to one column by adjusting attribute\nfn_csv_onecol <- tempfile(fileext = 'csv')\nwrite.table(b, file = fn_csv_onecol, quote=FALSE,\n     row.names=FALSE, col.names = FALSE, sep=',')\nfile.size(fn_csv_onecol)\n\n[1] 133889265\n\n\nConsider the following ways of reading the data into R (though similar results would be obtained in other languages). Explain the difference in speed between the three situations. Side note: in this case readr::read_csv() is rather faster than read.csv().\n\nsystem.time(a1 <- read.csv(fn_csv, header = FALSE))\n\n   user  system elapsed \n 27.635   0.336  27.979 \n\nsystem.time(a2 <- read.csv(fn_csv, header = FALSE,\n                    colClasses = 'numeric'))\n\n   user  system elapsed \n  2.473   0.056   2.530 \n\nsystem.time(a3 <- scan(fn_csv, sep = ','))\n\n   user  system elapsed \n  2.469   0.032   2.503 \n\n\nExplain why tmp.Rda is so much bigger than tmp2.Rda given they both contain the same number of numeric values.\n\nfn1_rda <- tempfile(fileext = 'Rda')\nsave(a, file = fn1_rda)\nfile.size(fn1_rda)\n\n[1] 76779127\n\nb <- rep(rnorm(1), 1e7)\nfn2_rda <- tempfile(fileext = 'Rda')\nsave(b, file = fn2_rda)\nfile.size(fn2_rda)\n\n[1] 116506\n\n\n\nPlease read Unit 4 on good programming/project practices and incorporate what you’ve learned from that reading into your solution for Problem 4. As your response to this question, briefly (a few sentences) note what you did in your code for Problem 4 that reflects the material in Sections 1.2 and 1.3 of Unit 4. Please also note anything in Unit 4 that you disagree with, if you have a different stylistic perspective.\nGo to Google Scholar and enter the name (including first name to help with disambiguation) for a researcher whose work interests you. (If you want to do the one that will match the problem set solutions, you can use “Jennifer Chayes”, who is Berkeley’s dean for data science.) If you’ve entered the name of a researcher that Google Scholar recognizes as having a Google Scholar profile, you should see that the first item returned is a “User profile”. Next, if you click on the hyperlink for the researcher under “User profiles for <researcher name>”, you’ll see that brings you to a page that provides the citations for all of the researcher’s papers. IMPORTANT: if you repeatedly query the Google Scholar site too quickly, Google will start returning “503” errors because it detects automated usage (see problem 5 below). So, if you are going to run code from a script such that multiple queries would get done in quick succession, please put something like Sys.sleep(2) in between the calls that do the HTTP requests. Also when developing your code, once you have the code in part (a) working to download the HTML, use the downloaded HTML to develop the remainder of your code and don’t keep re-downloading the HTML as you work on the remainder of the code.\n\nNow, based on the information returned by your work above, including the various URLs that your searching and clicking generated, write R code that will programmatically return the citation page for your researcher. Specifically, write a function whose input is the character string of the name of the researcher and whose output is the HTML (as an object of class xml_document) corresponding to the researcher’s citation page as well as the researcher’s Google Scholar ID.\nHint: you will need to use some string processing functions to extract the Scholar ID (and possibly for other things) from the output of the various rvest functions. I recommend functions from the stringr package (we’ll see these in Unit 5 and you can find information in Section 2.1.2 of the string processing tutorial), in particular: str_detect(), str_extract(), str_split(), and str_replace(). You should NOT need to use regular expressions (which we’ll cover in Unit 5), but you can if you want/know how to. Finally if you get an error message like this “Syntax error in regexp pattern. (U_REGEX_RULE_SYNTAX)”, it means the string processing function is interpreting the characters you are looking for as a regular expression. Simply wrap the string you are looking for in the fixed() function, e.g., fixed('sdf?=sd34') so the characters are simply interpreted as regular characters (i.e., interpreted literally).\nCreate a second function to process the resulting HTML to create an R data frame that contains the article title, authors, journal information, year of publication, and number of citations as five columns of information. Try your function on a second researcher to provide more confidence that your function is working properly.\nInclude checks in your code so that it fails gracefully if the user provides invalid input or Google Scholar doesn’t return a result. You don’t have to use the assertthat package as we won’t cover that until Section on Sep. 9, but you can if you want.\n(Extra credit) Fix your function so that you get all of the results for a researcher and not just the first 20.\n\nHint: as you are trying to understand the structure of the HTML, one option is to use write_xml() on the result of read_html() and then view the file that is produced in a text editor.\nNote: For simplicity you can either assume only one User Profile will be returned by your initial search or that you can just use the first of the profiles.\nLook at the robots.txt for Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) and the references in Unit 2 on the ethics of webscraping. Does it seem like it’s ok to scrape data from Google Scholar?\n(Extra Credit) The reticulate package and R Markdown allow you to have Python and R chunks in a document that interact with each other. Demonstrate the ability to use this functionality, in particular sending data from R to Python and back to R, with some processing done in Python (it doesn’t have to be complicated processing)."

Assign such numbers to variables with clear names, e.g., speedOfLight = 3e8.\nProvide reasonable default arguments to functions (or class methods) when possible.\nProvide tests (including unit tests) when requested (this is good general practice but we won’t require it in all cases).\nAvoid overly complicated syntax – try to use the clearest syntax you can to solve the problem.\nIn terms of speed, don’t worry about it too much so long as the code finishes real-world tasks in a reasonable amount of time. When optimizing, focus on the parts of the code that are the bottlenecks.\nUse functions already available in the language rather than recreating yourself."

    "text": "Statistics 243 is an introduction to statistical computing, taught using R. The course will cover both programming concepts and statistical computing concepts. Programming concepts will include data and text manipulation, data structures, functions and variable scope, regular expressions, debugging/testing, and parallel processing. Statistical computing topics will include working with large datasets, numerical linear algebra, computer arithmetic/precision, simulation studies and Monte Carlo methods, numerical optimization, and numerical integration/differentiation. A goal is that coverage of these topics complement the models/methods discussed in the rest of the statistics/biostatistics graduate curriculum. We will also cover the basics of UNIX/Linux, in particular some basic shell scripting and operating on remote servers, as well as a moderate amount of Python.\n\n\n\nWhile the course is taught using R and you will learn a lot about using R at an advanced level, this is not a course about learning R. Rather the focus of the course is computing for statistics and data science more generally, using R to illustrate the concepts.\nThis is not a course that will cover specific statistical/machine learning/data analysis methods.\n\n\n\n\nInformal prerequisites: If you are not a statistics or biostatistics graduate student, please chat with me if you’re not sure if this course makes sense for you. A background in calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics is expected, as well as a basic ability to operate on a computer (but I do not assume familiarity with the UNIX-style command line/terminal/shell). Furthermore, I’m expecting you will know the basics of R, at the level of the Modules 1-5 in the R bootcamp offered Aug. 20-21, 2022. If you don’t have that background you’ll need to spend time in the initial couple weeks getting up to speed. In addition, we’ll have an optional hands-on practice session during the second or third week of class, and the GSI can also provide assistance."

There is no remote option, and the only make-up accommodations I will make are for illness or serious personal issues. Do not schedule any travel that may conflict with a quiz.\n\n\nCourse grades\nThe grade for this course is primarily based on assignments due every 1-2 weeks, two quizzes (likely in early-mid October and mid-late November), and a final group project. I will also provide extra credit questions on some problem sets. There is no final exam. 50% of the grade is based on the problem sets, 25% on the quizzes, 15% on the project, and 10% on your participation in discussions on Ed, your responses to the in-class Google forms questions, as well as occasional brief questions that I will ask you to answer in advance of the next class.\nGrades will generally be As and Bs. An A involves doing all the work, getting full credit on most of the problem sets, doing well on the quizzes, and doing a thorough job on the final project.\n\n\nProblem sets\nWe will be less willing to help you if you come to our office hours or post a question online at the last minute. Working with computers can be unpredictable, so give yourself plenty of time for the assignments.\nThere are several rules for submitting your assignments.\n\nYou should prepare your assignments using either R Markdown (or the new Quarto format) or LaTeX plus knitr.\nProblem set submission consists of both of the following:\n\nA PDF submitted electronically through Gradescope, by the start of class (10 am) on the due date, and\nAn electronic copy of the PDF, code file, and R Markdown/Quarto/knitr document pushed to your class GitHub repository, following the instructions to be provided by the GSI.\n\nOn-time submission will be determined based on the time stamp of when the PDF is submitted to Gradescope.\nAnswers should consist of textual response or mathematical expressions as appropriate, with key chunks of code embedded within the document. Extensive additional code can be provided as an appendix. Before diving into the code for a problem, you should say what the goal of the code is and your strategy for solving the problem. Raw code without explanation is not an appropriate solution. Please see our qualitative grading rubric for guidance. In general the rubric is meant to reinforce good coding practices and high-quality scientific communication.\nAny mathematical derivations may be done by hand and scanned with your phone if you prefer that to writing up LaTeX equations.\n\nNote: R Markdown is an extension to the Markdown markup language that allows one to embed R code within an HTML document. Quarto is a new tool that generalizes R Markdown and provides the compatible qmd format. knitr is a tool that allows one to embed chunks of code within LaTeX documents, including with Overleaf and the LyX GUI front-end to LaTeX. Please see the SCF dynamics document tutorial; there will be additional information in the first section and on the first problem set.\n\n\nSubmitting assignments\nIn the first section (September 2), we’ll discuss how to submit your problem sets both on Gradescope and via your class GitHub repository, located at https://github.berkeley.edu/<your_calnet_username>.\n\n\nProblem set grading\nThe grading scheme for problem sets is as follows. Each problem set will receive a numeric score for (1) presentation and explanation of results, (2) technical accuracy of code or mathematical derivation, and (3) code quality/style and creativity. For each of these three components, the possible scores are:\n\n0 = no credit,\n1 = partial credit (you did some of the problems but not all),\n2 = satisfactory (you tried everything but there were pieces of what you did that didn’t solve or present/explain one or more problems in a complete way), and\n3 = full credit.\n\nAgain, the qualitative grading rubric provides guidance on what we want to see for full credit.\nFor components #1 and #3, many of you will get a score of 2 for some problem sets as you develop good coding practices. You can still get an A in the class despite this.\nYour total score for the PS is a weighted sum of the scores for the three components. If you turn in a PS late, I’ll bump you down by two points (out of the available). If you turn it in really late (e.g., after we start grading them), I will bump you down by four points. No credit after solutions are distributed.\n\n\nFinal project\nThe final project will be a joint coding project in groups of 3-4. I’ll assign an overall task, and you’ll be responsible for dividing up the work, coding, debugging, testing, and documentation. You’ll need to use the Git version control system for working in your group.\n\n\nRules for working together and the campus honor code\nI encourage you to work together and help each other out. However, the problem set solutions you submit must be your own. What do I mean by that?\n\nYou must first try to figure out a given problem on your own. After that, if you’re stuck or want to explore alternative approaches or check what you’ve done, feel free to consult with your fellow students and with the GSI and me.\nWhat does “consult with a fellow student mean”? You can discuss a problem with another student, brainstorm approaches, and share code syntax (generally not more than one line) on how to do small individual coding tasks within a problem.\n\nYou should not ask another student for complete code or solutions, or look at their code/solution.\nYou should not share complete code or solutions with another student or on Ed Discussion.\n\nYou must provide attribution for ideas obtained elsewhere, including other students.\n\nIf you got a specific idea for how to do part of a problem from a fellow student (or some other resource), you should note that in your solution in the appropriate place (for specific syntax ideas, note this in a code comment), just as you would cite a book or URL.\nYou MUST note on your problem set solution any fellow students who you worked/consulted with.\nYou do not need to cite any Ed Discussion posts nor any discussions with Chris or James.\n\nUltimately, your solution to a problem set (writeup and code) must be your own, and you’ll hear from me if either look too similar to someone else’s.\n\nPlease see the last section of this document for more information on the Campus Honor Code, which I expect you to follow."

    "text": "Campus Honor Code\nThe following is the Campus Honor Code. With regard to collaboration and independence, please see my rules regarding problem sets above – Chris.\nThe student community at UC Berkeley has adopted the following Honor Code: “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” The hope and expectation is that you will adhere to this code.\nCollaboration and Independence: Reviewing lecture and reading materials and studying for exams can be enjoyable and enriching things to do with fellow students. This is recommended. However, unless otherwise instructed, homework assignments are to be completed independently and materials submitted as homework should be the result of one’s own independent work.\nCheating: A good lifetime strategy is always to act in such a way that no one would ever imagine that you would even consider cheating. Anyone caught cheating on a quiz or exam in this course will receive a failing grade in the course and will also be reported to the University Center for Student Conduct. In order to guarantee that you are not suspected of cheating, please keep your eyes on your own materials and do not converse with others during the quizzes and exams.\nPlagiarism: To copy text or ideas from another source without appropriate reference is plagiarism and will result in a failing grade for your assignment and usually further disciplinary action. For additional information on plagiarism and how to avoid it, see, for example: http://gsi.berkeley.edu/teachingguide/misconduct/prevent-plag.html\nAcademic Integrity and Ethics: Cheating on exams and plagiarism are two common examples of dishonest, unethical behavior. Honesty and integrity are of great importance in all facets of life. They help to build a sense of self-confidence, and are key to building trust within relationships, whether personal or professional. There is no tolerance for dishonesty in the academic world, for it undermines what we are dedicated to doing – furthering knowledge for the benefit of humanity.\nYour experience as a student at UC Berkeley is hopefully fueled by passion for learning and replete with fulfilling activities. And we also appreciate that being a student may be stressful. There may be times when there is temptation to engage in some kind of cheating in order to improve a grade or otherwise advance your career. This could be as blatant as having someone else sit for you in an exam, or submitting a written assignment that has been copied from another source. And it could be as subtle as glancing at a fellow student’s exam when you are unsure of an answer to a question and are looking for some confirmation. One might do any of these things and potentially not get caught. However, if you cheat, no matter how much you may have learned in this class, you have failed to learn perhaps the most important lesson of all."

You should have software installed, be able to accesss the command line, and have started to become familiar with basic UNIX usage before class on Wednesday August 31.\nOptional R help session: (August 30 in Evans 334) If you are not familiar with R at the level of modules 1-5 of the R bootcamp, work through those modules and the breakout problems associated with the modules. If you’d like help and an opportunity for extra practice, please attend the special R catch-up session listed above. Some other resources for R are listed at the end of module 11 of the bootcamp materials, so you could also use those resources.

You can skip the pages on Regular Expressions and Managing Processes. Work through the first 10 problems in the exercises and submit your answers via Gradescope. This is not a formal problem set, so you don’t need to worry about formatting nor about explaining/commenting your answers, nor do you need to put your answers in your GitHub class repository. In fact it’s even fine with me if you hand-write the answers and scan them to an electronic document. I just want to make sure you’ve worked through the tutorial. I’ll be doing demonstrations on using the bash shell in class starting on Wednesday August 31, so that will be helpful as you work through the tutorial.\nLab 1: (September 2) First section/lab on using Git, setting up your GitHub repository for problem sets, and using R Markdown/Quarto/knitr to generate dynamic documents. Please come only to the section you are registered for given space limits in the room, unless you have talked with Chris and have his permission.\nRegular expression tutorial and exercises: (by September 9), read the regular expression material in the tutorial on using the bash shell. Also read Section 2.1 of the string processing tutorial (you can focus on Section 2.1.2 on stringr if you wish). Then answer the regular expressions (regex) practice problems and submit your answers via TBD.

You get best performance from the location closest to you.\n\nYou’re now on a paged titled The Comprehensive R Archive Network. The first box is labeled Downloand and Install R, click Download R for Windows\nClick base or install R for the first time, these take you to the same place\n\nFor more advanced things, you may need the Rtools download later. It isn’t necessary now, but remember that for the future.\n\nAt the top is a large-font link, Download R X.X.X for Windows, click this. It will begin downloading the Windows installer for R.\nFollow the instructions for setup. If you are unsure of anything, leave the default settings\n\n\n\nInstalling RStudio\nRStudio is one of the best text editors for coding in R. It is our recommended option for beginning. After you are comfortable with the language, or if you use other languages as well, you may want to explore Atom or Sublime. More advanced options include Emacs with [ESS package][https://ess.r-project.org/] and vim with the Nvim-R plugin.\nTo install RStudio:\n\nGo to the RStudio Desktop download page, rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nChoose the download for your OS, most likely the Windows 10/8/7 one\nFollow the instructions for setup. If you are unsure of anything, leave the default settings\nOpen RStudio (R will run automatically in the background)\n\nYou may have to allow RStudio to run if prompted (depends on security settings and anti-virus software)\n\n\nOnce RStudio is installed, you can install or update packages in one of two ways:\n\nVia the console, using install.packages() or update.packages()\n\nVia the gui:\n\nIn the top bar, click on tools\nSelect Install Packages… to install packages\nSelect Check for Package Updates… to update packages\n\n\n\n\nCompiling PDF Documents\nFor the purposes of this class, you will be submitting homeworks as PDF documents that blend written text, code, and code-generated output. These documents are RMarkdown documents, and are dynamic documents that provide a convenient method for documenting your work (more on this in one of the lab sections). To do this, you need a LaTeX renderer. We recommend MiKTeX for Windows.\n\nGo to Getting MiKTeX to download MiKTeX for Windows, miktex.org/download\nThe first page should be Install on Windows, click Download at the bottom of the page\n\nClick the download to begin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFOLLOW THESE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS.\nThe default options are fine in most places, but there is one that will cause problems.\n\n\n\nAccept the Copying Conditions, click next\nInstall only for you, click next\nUse the default directory, click next\nThis should be the Settings page.

This feature has to be enabled prior to installing Linux. There are two ways to do it.\n\nCMD Line\nThe simplest way to enable the Linux subsystem is through PowerShell.\n\nOpen PowerShell as Administrator\nRun the following (on one line):\nEnable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux\nRestart the computer\n\nGUI\nIf you don’t wish to use PowerShell, you can work your way through the control panel and turn on the Linux subsystem.\n\nOpen the settings page through the search bar\nGo to Programs and Features\nFind Turn Windows Features on or off on the right side\nEnable the Windows Subsystem for Linux option\nRestart the computer\n\n\n\n\n2) Install Linux Subsystem\nOnce the Linux subsystem feature has been enabled, there are multiple methods to download and install the Linux distro you want. I highly recommend installing Ubuntu from the Microsoft store. There are several other flavors available as well, but Ubuntu is generally the easiest to learn and the most well supported.\n\nOpen the Microsoft Store\nSearch for Ubuntu\n\nYou’re looking for the highest number followed by LTS, currently 20.04 LTS (or 18.04 LTS is fine too). This is the current long-term-release, meaning it will be supported for the next 5 years.\n\nClick on the tile, then click Get, and this should start the installation.\nFollow the prompts to install Ubuntu.\n\nAfter installing Ubuntu, it is advisable to update it.

Any files created under the Linux subsystem, only modify them with Linux tools. In contrast, you can create files in the Windows system and modify them with both Windows or Linux tools. There could be file permission issues because Windows doesn’t have the same concept of file permissions as Linux. So, if you intend to work on files using both Linux and Windows, create the files in the C drive under Windows, and you should be safe to edit them with either OS."

    "text": "Text and binary files\nIn general, files can be divided into text files and binary files. In both cases, information is stored as a series of bits. Recall that a bit is a single value in base 2 (i.e., a 0 or a 1), while a byte is 8 bits.\nA text file is one in which the bits in the file encode individual characters. Note that the characters can include the digit characters 0-9, so one can include numbers in a text file by writing down the digits needed for the number of interest. Examples of text file formats include CSV, XML, HTML, and JSON.\nText files may be simple ASCII files (i.e., files encoded using ASCII) or in other encodings such as UTF-8, both covered in Section 5. ASCII files have 8 bits (1 byte) per character and can represent 128 characters (the 52 lower and upper case letters in English, 10 digits, punctuation and a few other things – basically what you see on a standard US keyboard). UTF-8 files have between 1 and 4 bytes per character.\nA binary file is one in which the bits in the file encode the information in a custom format and not simply individual characters. Binary formats are not (easily) human readable but can be more space-efficient and faster to work with (because it can allow random access into the data rather than requiring sequential reading). The meaning of the bytes in such files depends on the specific binary format being used and a program that uses the file needs to know how the format represents information. Examples of binary files include netCDF files, R data (e.g., .Rda) files, Python pickle files, and compiled code files.\nNumbers in binary files are usually stored as 8 bytes per number. We’ll discuss this much more in Unit 8."

    "section": "Common file types",
    "text": "Common file types\nHere are some of the common file types, some of which are text formats and some of which are binary formats.\n\n‘Flat’ text files: data are often provided as simple text files. Often one has one record or observation per row and each column or field is a different variable or type of information about the record. Such files can either have a fixed number of characters in each field (fixed width format) or a special character (a delimiter) that separates the fields in each row. Common delimiters are tabs, commas, one or more spaces, and the pipe (|). Common file extensions are .txt and .csv. Metadata (information about the data) are often stored in a separate file. CSV files are quite common, but if you have files where the data contain commas, other delimiters can be good. Text can be put in quotes in CSV files, and this can allow use of commas within the data. This is difficult to deal with from the command line, but read.table() in R handles this situation.\n\nOne occasionally tricky difficulty is as follows. If you have a text file created in Windows, the line endings are coded differently than in UNIX. Windows uses a newline (the ASCII character \\n) and a carriage return (the ASCII character \\r) whereas UNIX uses onlyl a newline in UNIX). There are UNIX utilities (fromdos in Ubuntu, including the SCF Linux machines and dos2unix in other Linux distributions) that can do the necessary conversion. If you see ^M at the end of the lines in a file, that’s the tool you need. Alternatively, if you open a UNIX file in Windows, it may treat all the lines as a single line. You can fix this with todos or unix2dos.\n\nIn some contexts, such as textual data and bioinformatics data, the data may be in a text file with one piece of information per row, but without meaningful columns/fields.\nIn scientific contexts, netCDF (.nc) (and the related HDF5) are popular format for gridded data that allows for highly-efficient storage and contains the metadata within the file. The basic structure of a netCDF file is that each variable is an array with multiple dimensions (e.g., latitude, longitude, and time), and one can also extract the values of and metadata about each dimension. The ncdf4 package in R nicely handles working with netCDF files.\nData may also be in text files in formats designed for data interchange between various languages, in particular XML or JSON. These formats are “self-describing”; namely the metadata is part of the file. The XML2, rvest, and jsonlite packages are useful for reading and writing from these formats. More in Section 4.\nYou may be scraping information on the web, so dealing with text files in various formats, including HTML. The XML2 and rvest packages are also useful for reading HTML.\nData may already be in a database or in the data storage format of another statistical package (Stata, SAS, SPSS, etc.). The foreign package in R has excellent capabilities for importing Stata (read.dta()), SPSS (read.spss()), and SAS (read.ssd() and, for XPORT files, read.xport()), among others.\nFor Excel, there are capabilities to read an Excel file (see the readxl and XLConnect package among others), but you can also just go into Excel and export as a CSV file or the like and then read that into R. In general, it’s best not to pass around data files as Excel or other spreadsheet format files because (1) Excel is proprietary, so someone may not have Excel and the format is subject to change, (2) Excel imposes limits on the number of rows, (3) one can easily manipulate text files such as CSV using UNIX tools, but this is not possible with an Excel file, (4) Excel files often have more than one sheet, graphs, macros, etc., so they’re not a data storage format per se.\nR can easily interact with databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, etc.), querying the database using SQL and returning results to R. More in the big data unit and in the large datasets tutorial mentioned above."

It reads in delimited files (read.csv() and read.delim() are special cases of read.table()). The key arguments are the delimiter (the sep argument) and whether the file contains a header, a line with the variable names. We can use read.fwf() to read from a fixed width text file into a data frame.\nThe most difficult part of reading in such files can be dealing with how R determines the classes of the fields that are read in. There are a number of arguments to read.table() and read.fwf() that allow the user to control the classes. One difficulty in older versions of R was that character fields were read in as factors.\nLet’s work through a couple examples. Before we do that, let’s look at the arguments to read.table().

Using the UNIX command less on RTADataSub.csv would have revealed these various issues, but note that RTADataSub.csv is a 1000-line subset of a much larger file of data available from the kaggle.com website. So more sophisticated use of UNIX utilities (as we will see in Unit 3) is often useful before trying to read something into a program.\nThe basic function scan() simply reads everything in, ignoring lines, which works well and very quickly if you are reading in a numeric vector or matrix. scan() is also useful if your file is free format - i.e., if it’s not one line per observation, but just all the data one value after another; in this case you can use scan() to read it in and then format the resulting character or numeric vector as a matrix with as many columns as fields in the dataset. Remember that the default is to fill the matrix by column.\nIf the file is not nicely arranged by field (e.g., if it has ragged lines), we’ll need to do some more work. readLines() will read in each line into a separate character vector, after which we can process the lines using text manipulation. Here’s an example from some US meteorological data where I know from metadata (not provided here) that the 4-11th values are an identifier, the 17-20th are the year, the 22-23rd the month, etc.\n\ndat <- readLines(file.path('..', 'data', 'precip.txt'))\nid <- as.factor(substring(dat, 4, 11) )\nyear <- substring(dat, 18, 21)\nyear[1:5]\n\n[1] \"2010\" \"2010\" \"2010\" \"2010\" \"2010\"\n\nclass(year)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nyear <- as.integer(substring(dat, 18, 21))\nmonth <- as.integer(substring(dat, 22, 23))\nnvalues <- as.integer(substring(dat, 28, 30))\n\nActually, that file, precip.txt, is in a fixed-width format (i.e., every element in a given column has the exact same number of characters),so reading in using read.fwf() would be a good strategy."

This can include reading in text from the output of running a shell command and from unzipping a file on the fly.\nHere are some examples of connections:\n\ndat <- readLines(pipe(\"ls -al\"))\ndat <- read.table(pipe(\"unzip dat.zip\"))\ndat <- read.csv(gzfile(\"dat.csv.gz\"))\ndat <- readLines(\"http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~paciorek/index.html\")\n\nIn some cases, you might need to create the connection using url() or using the curl() function from the curl package. Though for the example here, simply passing the URL to readLines() does work. (In general, curl::curl() provides some nice features for reading off the internet.)\n\nwikip1 <- readLines(\"https://wikipedia.org\")\nwikip2 <- readLines(url(\"https://wikipedia.org\"))\nlibrary(curl)\n\nUsing libcurl 7.68.0 with GnuTLS/3.6.13\n\nwikip3 <- readLines(curl(\"https://wikipedia.org\"))\n\nIf a file is large, we may want to read it in in chunks (of lines), do some computations to reduce the size of things, and iterate. This is referred to as online processing. read.table(), read.fwf() and readLines() all have the arguments that let you read in a fixed number of lines. To read-on-the-fly in blocks, we need to first establish the connection and then read from it sequentially.

    "text": "Formatting output\ncat() is a good choice for printing a message to the screen, often better than print(), which is an object-oriented method.

For example, the default with write and cat is the number of digits that R displays to the screen, controlled by options()$digits. But note that options()$digits seems to have some variability in behavior across operating systems. If you want finer control, use sprintf. For example, here we print out temperatures as reals (“f”=floating point) with four decimal places and nine total character positions, followed by a C for Celsius:\n\ntemps <- c(12.5, 37.234324, 1342434324.79997234, 2.3456e-6, 1e10)\nsprintf(\"%9.4f C\", temps)\n\n[1] \"  12.5000 C\"        \"  37.2343 C\"        \"1342434324.8000 C\" \n[4] \"   0.0000 C\"        \"10000000000.0000 C\"\n\ncity <- \"Boston\"\nsprintf(\"The temperature in %s was %.4f C.\", city, temps[1])\n\n[1] \"The temperature in Boston was 12.5000 C.\"\n\nsprintf(\"The temperature in %s was %9.4f C.\", city, temps[1])\n\n[1] \"The temperature in Boston was   12.5000 C.\"\n\n\nTo change the number of digits printed to the screen, do options(digits = 5) or specify as an argument to print or use sprintf."

In simple webpages (ignoring the more complicated pages that involve Javascript), what you see in your browser is simply a rendering (by the browser) of a text file containing HTML.\nHowever, instead of rendering the HTML in a browser, we might want to use code to extract information from the HTML.\nLet’s see a brief example of reading in HTML tables.\nNote that before doing any coding, it can be helpful to look at the raw HTML source code for a given page. We can explore the underlying HTML source in advance of writing our code by looking at the page source directly in the browser (e.g., in Firefox under the 3-lines “open menu” symbol, see Web Developer (or More Tools) -> Page Source and in Chrome View -> Developer -> View Source), or by downloading the webpage and looking at it in an editor, although in some cases (such as the nytimes.com case), what we might see is a lot of JavaScript.\nOne lesson here is not to write a lot of your own code to do something that someone else has probably already written a package for.

Then html_elements() finds the HTML tables and html_table() converts them to data frames. rvest is part of the tidyverse, so it’s often used with piping, e.g.,\n\n## Turns out that html_table can take the entire html doc as input\ntbls <- URL |> read_html() |> html_table()\n\nIt’s often useful to be able to extract the hyperlinks in an HTML document. We’ll find the link using CSS selectors, which allow you to search for elements within HTML:\n\nURL <- \"http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year\"\n## approach 1: search for elements with 'href' attribute\nlinks <- read_html(URL) %>% html_elements(\"[href]\") %>% html_attr('href')\n## approach 2: search for HTML 'a' tags\nlinks <- read_html(URL) %>% html_elements(\"a\") %>% html_attr('href')\nhead(links, n = 10)\n\n [1] \"?C=N;O=D\"              \"?C=M;O=A\"              \"?C=S;O=A\"             \n [4] \"?C=D;O=A\"              \"/pub/data/ghcn/daily/\" \"1750.csv.gz\"          \n [7] \"1763.csv.gz\"           \"1764.csv.gz\"           \"1765.csv.gz\"          \n[10] \"1766.csv.gz\"          \n\n\nMore generally, we may want to read an HTML document, parse it into its components (i.e., the HTML elements), and navigate through the tree structure of the HTML.

Some examples of the use of XML include serving as the underlying format for Microsoft Office and Google Docs documents and for the KML language used for spatial information in Google Earth.\nHere’s a brief example.

We’ll first show the ‘brute force’ approach of working with the data as a list and then the better approach of using XPath.\n\nlibrary(xml2)\ndoc <- read_xml(\"https://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/newest.xml\")\ndata <- as_list(doc)\nnames(data)\n\n[1] \"response\"\n\nnames(data$response)\n\n[1] \"paging\" \"loans\" \n\nlength(data$response$loans)\n\n[1] 20\n\ndata$response$loans[[2]][c('name', 'activity',\n                           'sector', 'location', 'loan_amount')]\n\n$name\n$name[[1]]\n[1] \"Elysa\"\n\n\n$activity\n$activity[[1]]\n[1] \"Agriculture\"\n\n\n$sector\n$sector[[1]]\n[1] \"Agriculture\"\n\n\n$location\n$location$country_code\n$location$country_code[[1]]\n[1] \"MG\"\n\n\n$location$country\n$location$country[[1]]\n[1] \"Madagascar\"\n\n\n$location$town\n$location$town[[1]]\n[1] \"Faravohitra\"\n\n\n$location$geo\n$location$geo$level\n$location$geo$level[[1]]\n[1] \"town\"\n\n\n$location$geo$pairs\n$location$geo$pairs[[1]]\n[1] \"-18.909749 47.530918\"\n\n\n$location$geo$type\n$location$geo$type[[1]]\n[1] \"point\"\n\n\n\n\n$loan_amount\n$loan_amount[[1]]\n[1] \"200\"\n\n## alternatively, extract only the 'loans' info (and use pipes)\nloansNode <- doc %>% html_elements('loans')\nloanInfo <- loansNode %>% xml_children() %>% as_list()\nlength(loanInfo)\n\n[1] 20\n\nnames(loanInfo[[1]])\n\n [1] \"id\"                       \"name\"                    \n [3] \"description\"              \"status\"                  \n [5] \"funded_amount\"            \"basket_amount\"           \n [7] \"image\"                    \"activity\"                \n [9] \"sector\"                   \"themes\"                  \n[11] \"use\"                      \"location\"                \n[13] \"partner_id\"               \"posted_date\"             \n[15] \"planned_expiration_date\"  \"loan_amount\"             \n[17] \"borrower_count\"           \"lender_count\"            \n[19] \"bonus_credit_eligibility\" \"tags\"                    \n\nnames(loanInfo[[1]]$location)\n\n[1] \"country_code\" \"country\"      \"town\"         \"geo\"         \n\n## suppose we only want the country locations of the loans (using XPath)\nxml_find_all(loansNode, '//location//country')\n\n{xml_nodeset (20)}\n [1] <country>Indonesia</country>\n [2] <country>Madagascar</country>\n [3] <country>Kenya</country>\n [4] <country>Kenya</country>\n [5] <country>Kosovo</country>\n [6] <country>Kenya</country>\n [7] <country>Kenya</country>\n [8] <country>Nepal</country>\n [9] <country>Vanuatu</country>\n[10] <country>Moldova</country>\n[11] <country>Solomon Islands</country>\n[12] <country>Solomon Islands</country>\n[13] <country>Indonesia</country>\n[14] <country>Indonesia</country>\n[15] <country>Indonesia</country>\n[16] <country>Indonesia</country>\n[17] <country>Indonesia</country>\n[18] <country>Indonesia</country>\n[19] <country>Jordan</country>\n[20] <country>Jordan</country>\n\nxml_find_all(loansNode, '//location//country') %>% xml_text()\n\n [1] \"Indonesia\"       \"Madagascar\"      \"Kenya\"           \"Kenya\"          \n [5] \"Kosovo\"          \"Kenya\"           \"Kenya\"           \"Nepal\"          \n [9] \"Vanuatu\"         \"Moldova\"         \"Solomon Islands\" \"Solomon Islands\"\n[13] \"Indonesia\"       \"Indonesia\"       \"Indonesia\"       \"Indonesia\"      \n[17] \"Indonesia\"       \"Indonesia\"       \"Jordan\"          \"Jordan\"         \n\n## or extract the geographic coordinates\nxml_find_all(loansNode, '//location//geo/pairs')\n\n{xml_nodeset (20)}\n [1] <pairs>-6.178056 106.63</pairs>\n [2] <pairs>-18.909749 47.530918</pairs>\n [3] <pairs>0.782681 34.720204</pairs>\n [4] <pairs>0.416667 34.25</pairs>\n [5] <pairs>42.583333 21</pairs>\n [6] <pairs>0.05 37.65</pairs>\n [7] <pairs>0.416667 34.25</pairs>\n [8] <pairs>27.719635 85.329775</pairs>\n [9] <pairs>-17.733251 168.327325</pairs>\n[10] <pairs>45.9075 28.194444</pairs>\n[11] <pairs>-9.445638 159.9729</pairs>\n[12] <pairs>-9.445638 159.9729</pairs>\n[13] <pairs>-6.178056 106.63</pairs>\n[14] <pairs>-6.110366 106.163975</pairs>\n[15] <pairs>-6.178056 106.63</pairs>\n[16] <pairs>-6.178056 106.63</pairs>\n[17] <pairs>-6.178056 106.63</pairs>\n[18] <pairs>-6.110366 106.163975</pairs>\n[19] <pairs>31 36</pairs>\n[20] <pairs>32.560923 36.008697</pairs>"

    "text": "Webscraping and web APIs\nHere we’ll see some examples of making requests over the Web to get data. We’ll use APIs to systematically query a website for information. Ideally, but not always, the API will be documented. In many cases that simply amounts to making an HTTP GET request, which is done by constructing a URL.\nThe packages RCurl and httr are useful for a wide variety of such functionality. Note that much of the functionality I describe below is also possible within the shell using either wget or curl.\n\nWebscraping ethics and best practices\nWebscraping is the process of extracting data from the web, either directly from a website or using a web API (application programming interface).\n\nShould you webscrape? In general, if we can avoid webscraping (particularly if there is not an API) and instead directly download a data file from a website, that is greatly preferred.\nMay you webscrape? Before you set up any automated downloading of materials/data from the web you should make sure that what you are about to do is consistent with the rules provided by the website.\n\nSome places to look for information on what the website allows are:\n\nlegal pages such as Terms of Service or Terms and Conditions on the website.\ncheck the robots.txt file (e.g., https://scholar.google.com/robots.txt) to see what a web crawler is allowed to do, and whether the site requires a particular delay between requests to the sites\npotentially contact the site owner if you plan to scrape a large amount of data\n\nHere are some links with useful information:\n\nA blog post overview on webscraping and robots.txt\nBlog post on webscraping ethics\nSome information on how to understand a robots.txt file\n\nTips for when you make automated requests:\n\nWhen debugging code that processes the result of such a request, just run the request once, save (i.e., cache) the result, and then work on the processing code applied to the result. Don’t make the same request over and over again.\nIn many cases you will want to include a time delay between your automated requests to a site, including if you are not actually crawling a site but just want to automate a small number of queries.\n\n\n\nWhat is HTTP?\nHTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) is a system for communicating information from a server (i.e., the website of interest) to a client (e.g., your laptop). The client sends a request and the server sends a response.\nWhen you go to a website in a browser, your browser makes an HTTP GET request to the website. Similarly, when we did some downloading of html from webpages above, we used an HTTP GET request.\nAnytime the URL you enter includes parameter information after a question mark (www.somewebsite.com?param1=arg1&param2=arg2), you are using an API.\nThe response to an HTTP request will include a status code, which can be interpreted based on this information.\nThe response will generally contain content in the form of text (e.g., HTML, XML, JSON) or raw bytes.\n\n\nAPIs: REST- and SOAP-based web services\nIdeally a web service documents their API (Applications Programming Interface) that serves data or allows other interactions. REST and SOAP are popular API standards/styles. Both REST and SOAP use HTTP requests; we’ll focus on REST as it is more common and simpler. When using REST, we access resources, which might be a Facebook account or a database of stock quotes. The API will (hopefully) document what information it expects from the user and will return the result in a standard format (often a particular file format rather than producing a webpage).\nOften the format of the request is a URL (aka an endpoint) plus a query string, passed as a GET request. Let’s search for plumbers near Berkeley, and we’ll see the GET request, in the form:\nhttps://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=plumbers&find_loc=Berkeley+CA&ns=1\n\nthe query string begins with ?\nthere are one or more Parameter=Argument pairs\npairs are separated by &\n+ is used in place of each space\n\nLet’s see an example of accessing economic data from the World Bank, using the documentation for their API. Following the API call structure, we can download (for example), data on various countries. The documentation indicates that our REST-based query can use either a URL structure or an argument-based structure.\n\n## Queries based on the documentation\napi_url <- \"http://api.worldbank.org/V2/incomeLevel/LIC/country\"\napi_args <- \"http://api.worldbank.org/V2/country?incomeLevel=LIC\"\n\n## Generalizing a bit\nreq <- \"http://api.worldbank.org/V2/country?incomeLevel=MIC&format=json\"\ndata <- fromJSON(req)\n## Be careful of data truncation/pagination\nreq <- \"http://api.worldbank.org/V2/country?incomeLevel=MIC&format=json&per_page=1000\"\ndata <- fromJSON(req)\n\n## Programmatic control\nbaseURL <- \"http://api.worldbank.org/V2/country\"\ngroup <- 'MIC'\nformat <- 'json'\nargs <- c(incomeLevel = group, format = format, per_page = 1000)\nurl <- paste0(baseURL, \"?\",\n    paste(  paste(names(args), args, sep = \"=\"),  collapse = \"&\"))\n   \ndata <- fromJSON(url)\nclass(data)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\nlength(data)\n\n[1] 2\n\nnames(data)\n\nNULL\n\nhead(data[[2]])\n\n   id iso2Code           name region.id region.iso2code\n1 AGO       AO         Angola       SSF              ZG\n2 ALB       AL        Albania       ECS              Z7\n3 ARG       AR      Argentina       LCN              ZJ\n4 ARM       AM        Armenia       ECS              Z7\n5 ASM       AS American Samoa       EAS              Z4\n6 AZE       AZ     Azerbaijan       ECS              Z7\n                region.value adminregion.id adminregion.iso2code\n1        Sub-Saharan Africa             SSA                   ZF\n2      Europe & Central Asia            ECA                   7E\n3 Latin America & Caribbean             LAC                   XJ\n4      Europe & Central Asia            ECA                   7E\n5        East Asia & Pacific            EAP                   4E\n6      Europe & Central Asia            ECA                   7E\n                                  adminregion.value incomeLevel.id\n1        Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding high income)            LMC\n2     Europe & Central Asia (excluding high income)            UMC\n3 Latin America & Caribbean (excluding high income)            UMC\n4     Europe & Central Asia (excluding high income)            UMC\n5       East Asia & Pacific (excluding high income)            UMC\n6     Europe & Central Asia (excluding high income)            UMC\n  incomeLevel.iso2code   incomeLevel.value lendingType.id lendingType.iso2code\n1                   XN Lower middle income            IBD                   XF\n2                   XT Upper middle income            IBD                   XF\n3                   XT Upper middle income            IBD                   XF\n4                   XT Upper middle income            IBD                   XF\n5                   XT Upper middle income            LNX                   XX\n6                   XT Upper middle income            IBD                   XF\n  lendingType.value  capitalCity longitude latitude\n1              IBRD       Luanda    13.242 -8.81155\n2              IBRD       Tirane   19.8172  41.3317\n3              IBRD Buenos Aires  -58.4173 -34.6118\n4              IBRD      Yerevan    44.509  40.1596\n5    Not classified    Pago Pago  -170.691 -14.2846\n6              IBRD         Baku   49.8932  40.3834\n\n\nAPIs can change and disappear. Last year the example above involved the World Bank’s Climate Data API, which I can no longer find!\nAs another example, here we can see the US Treasury Department API, which allows us to construct queries for federal financial data.\nThe Nolan and Temple Lang book provides a number of examples of different ways of authenticating with web services that control access to the service.\nFinally, some web services allow us to pass information to the service in addition to just getting data or information. E.g., you can programmatically interact with your Facebook, Dropbox, and Google Drive accounts using REST based on HTTP POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. Authentication is of course important in these contexts and some times you would first authenticate with your login and password and receive a “token”. This token would then be used in subsequent interactions in the same session.\nI created your github.berkeley.edu accounts from Python by interacting with the GitHub API using the requests package.\n\n\nHTTP requests by deconstructing an (undocumented) API\nIn some cases an API may not be documented or we might be lazy and not use the documentation. Instead we might deconstruct the queries a browser makes and then mimic that behavior, in some cases having to parse HTML output to get at data. Note that if the webpage changes even a little bit, our carefully constructed query syntax may fail.\nLet’s look at some UN data (agricultural crop data). By going to\nhttp://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx?d=FAO, and clicking on “Crops”, we’ll see a bunch of agricultural products with “View data” links. Click on “apricots” as an example and you’ll see a “Download” button that allows you to download a CSV of the data. Let’s select a range of years and then try to download “by hand”. Sometimes we can right-click on the link that will download the data and directly see the URL that is being accessed and then one can deconstruct it so that you can create URLs programmatically to download the data you want.\nIn this case, we can’t see the full URL that is being used because there’s some Javascript involved. Therefore, rather than looking at the URL associated with a link we need to view the actual HTTP request sent by our browser to the server. We can do this using features of the browser (e.g., in Firefox see Web Developer -> Network and in Chrome View -> Developer -> Developer tools and choose the Network tab) (or right-click on the webpage and select Inspect and then Network). Based on this we can see that an HTTP GET request is being used with a URL such as:\nhttp://data.un.org/Handlers/DownloadHandler.ashx?DataFilter=itemCode:526;year:2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017&DataMartId=FAO&Format=csv&c=2,4,5,6,7&s=countryName:asc,elementCode:asc,year:desc.\nWe’e now able to easily download the data using that URL, which we can fairly easily construct using string processing in bash, R, or Python, such as this (here I just paste it together directly, but using more structured syntax such as I used for the World Bank example would be better):\n\n## example URL:\n## http://data.un.org/Handlers/DownloadHandler.ashx?DataFilter=itemCode:526;\n##year:2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017&DataMartId=FAO&Format=csv&c=2,4,5,6,7&\n##s=countryName:asc,elementCode:asc,year:desc\nitemCode <- 526\nbaseURL <- \"http://data.un.org/Handlers/DownloadHandler.ashx\"\nyrs <- paste(as.character(2012:2017), collapse = \",\")\nfilter <- paste0(\"?DataFilter=itemCode:\", itemCode, \";year:\", yrs)\nargs1 <- \"&DataMartId=FAO&Format=csv&c=2,3,4,5,6,7&\"\nargs2 <- \"s=countryName:asc,elementCode:asc,year:desc\"\nurl <- paste0(baseURL, filter, args1, args2)\n## if the website provided a CSV we could just do this:\n## apricots <- read.csv(url)\n## but it zips the file\ntemp <- tempfile()  ## give name for a temporary file\ndownload.file(url, temp)\ndat <- read.csv(unzip(temp))  ## using a connection (see Section 2)\n\nhead(dat)\n\n  Country.or.Area Element.Code                                         Element\n1     Afghanistan          432 Gross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n2     Afghanistan          432 Gross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n3     Afghanistan          432 Gross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n4     Afghanistan          432 Gross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n5     Afghanistan          432 Gross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n6     Afghanistan          432 Gross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n  Year  Unit  Value Value.Footnotes\n1 2017 index 202.19              Fc\n2 2016 index  27.45              Fc\n3 2015 index 134.50              Fc\n4 2014 index 138.05              Fc\n5 2013 index 138.05              Fc\n6 2012 index 128.08              Fc\n\n\nSo, what have we achieved?\n\nWe have a reproducible workflow we can share with others (perhaps ourself in the future).\nWe can automate the process of downloading many such files.\n\n\n\nMore details on HTTP requests\nA more sophisticated way to do the download is to pass the request in a structured way with named input parameters. This request is easier to construct programmatically. Here what is returned is a zip file, which is represented in R as a sequence of “raw” bytes. We can use httr’s GET(), followed by writing to disk and reading back in, as follows (for some reason knitr won’t print the output…):\n\nlibrary(httr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'httr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:curl':\n\n    handle_reset\n\noutput2 <- GET(baseURL, query = list(\n               DataFilter = paste0(\"itemCode:\", itemCode, \";year:\", yrs),\n               DataMartID = \"FAO\", Format = \"csv\", c = \"2,3,4,5,6,7\",\n               s = \"countryName:asc,elementCode:asc,year:desc\"))\ntemp <- tempfile()  ## give name for a temporary file\nwriteBin(content(output2, 'raw'), temp)  ## write out as zip file\ndat <- read.csv(unzip(temp))\nhead(dat)\n\n  Country.or.Area Element.Code                                         Element\n1     Afghanistan          432 Gross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n2     Afghanistan          432 Gross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n3     Afghanistan          432 Gross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n4     Afghanistan          432 Gross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n5     Afghanistan          432 Gross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n6     Afghanistan          432 Gross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100)\n  Year  Unit  Value Value.Footnotes\n1 2017 index 202.19              Fc\n2 2016 index  27.45              Fc\n3 2015 index 134.50              Fc\n4 2014 index 138.05              Fc\n5 2013 index 138.05              Fc\n6 2012 index 128.08              Fc\n\n\nIn some cases we may need to send a lot of information as part of the URL in a GET request. If it gets to be too long (e.g,, more than 2048 characters) many web servers will reject the request. Instead we may need to use an HTTP POST request (POST requests are often used for submitting web forms). A typical request would have syntax like this search (using RCurl):\n\nif(url.exists('http://www.wormbase.org/db/searches/advanced/dumper')) {\n      x = postForm('http://www.wormbase.org/db/searches/advanced/dumper',\n              species=\"briggsae\",\n              list=\"\",\n              flank3=\"0\",\n              flank5=\"0\",\n              feature=\"Gene Models\",\n              dump = \"Plain TEXT\",\n              orientation = \"Relative to feature\",\n              relative = \"Chromsome\",\n              DNA =\"flanking sequences only\",\n              .cgifields = paste(c(\"feature\", \"orientation\", \"DNA\",\n                                   \"dump\",\"relative\"), collapse=\", \"))\n}\n\nUnfortunately that specific search doesn’t work because the server URL and/or API seem to have changed. But it gives you an idea of what the format would look like.\nhttr and RCurl can handle other kinds of HTTP requests such as PUT and DELETE. Finally, some websites use cookies to keep track of users and you may need to download a cookie in the first interaction with the HTTP server and then send that cookie with later interactions. More details are available in the Nolan and Temple Lang book.\n\n\nPackaged access to an API\nFor popular websites/data sources, a developer may have packaged up the API calls in a user-friendly fashion for use from R, Python or other software. For example there are Python (twitter) and R (twitteR) packages for interfacing with Twitter via its API.\nHere’s some example code for Python (the Python package seems to be more fully-featured than the R package). This looks up the US senators’ Twitter names and then downloads a portion of each of their timelines, i.e., the time series of their tweets. Note that Twitter has limits on how much one can download at once.\n\nimport json\nimport twitter\n\n# You will need to set the following variables with your\n# personal information.  To do this you will need to create\n# a personal account on Twitter (if you don't already have\n# one).  Once you've created an account, create a new\n# application here:\n#    https://dev.twitter.com/apps\n#\n# You can manage your applications here:\n#    https://apps.twitter.com/\n#\n# Select your application and then under the section labeled\n# \"Key and Access Tokens\", you will find the information needed\n# below.  Keep this information private.\nCONSUMER_KEY       = \"\"\nCONSUMER_SECRET    = \"\"\nOAUTH_TOKEN        = \"\"\nOAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET = \"\"\n\nauth = twitter.oauth.OAuth(OAUTH_TOKEN, OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET,\n                           CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET)\napi = twitter.Twitter(auth=auth)\n\n# get the list of senators\nsenators = api.lists.members(owner_screen_name=\"gov\", slug=\"us-senate\", count=100)\n\n# get all the senators' timelines\nnames = [d[\"screen_name\"] for d in senators[\"users\"]]\ntimelines = [api.statuses.user_timeline(screen_name=name, count = 500) \n             for name in names]\n\n# save information out to JSON\nwith open(\"senators-list.json\", \"w\") as f:\n    json.dump(senators, f, indent=4, sort_keys=True)\nwith open(\"timelines.json\", \"w\") as f:\n    json.dump(timelines, f, indent=4, sort_keys=True)\n\n\n\nAccessing dynamic pages\nSome websites dynamically change in reaction to the user behavior. In these cases you need a tool that can mimic the behavior of a human interacting with a site. Some options are:\n\nselenium (and the RSelenium wrapper for R) is a popular tool for doing this.\nsplash (and the splashr wrapper for R) is another approach.\nhtmlunit is another tool for this."

In R one can do something similar with named vectors or named lists or (more efficiently) by using environments.\n\nIn Unit 7, we’ll talk about distributed data structures that allow one to easily work with data distributed across multiple computers."

    "section": "Other kinds of data structures",
    "text": "Other kinds of data structures\nYou may have heard of various other kinds of data structures, such as linked lists, trees, graphs, queues, and stacks. One of the key aspects that differentiate such data structures is how one navigates through the elements.\nSets are collections of elements that don’t have any duplicates (like a mathematical set).\nWith a linked list, with each element (or node) has a value and a pointer (reference) to the location of the next element. (With a doubly-linked list, there is also a pointer back to the previous element.) One big advantage of this is that one can insert an element by simply modifying the pointers involved at the site of the insertion, without copying any of the other elements in the list. A big disadvantage is that to get to an element you have to navigate through the list.\n\n\n\nLinked list (courtesy of computersciencewiki.org)\n\n\nBoth trees and graphs are collections of nodes (vertices) and links (edges). A tree involves a set of nodes and links to child nodes (also possibly containing information linking the child nodes to their parent nodes). With a graph, the links might not be directional, and there can be cycles.\n\n\n\nTree (courtesy of computersciencewiki.org)\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph (courtesy of computersciencewiki.org)\n\n\nA stack is a collection of elements that behave like a stack of lunch trays. You can only access the top element directly(“last in, first out”), so the operations are that you can push a new element onto the stack or pop the top element off the stack. In fact, nested function calls behave as stacks, and the memory used in the process of evaluating the function calls is called the ‘stack’.\nA queue is like the line at a grocery store, behaving as “first in, first out”.\nOne can use such data structures either directly or via add-on packages in R and Python, though I don’t think they’re all that commonly used in R. This is probably because statistical/data science/machine learning workflows often involve either ‘rectangular’ data (i.e., dataframe-style data) and/or mathematical computations with arrays. That said, trees and graphs are widely used.\nSome related concepts that we’ll discuss further in Unit 5 include:\n\ntypes: this refers to how a given piece of information is stored and what operations can be done with the information.\n\n‘primitive’ types are the most basic types that often relate directly to how data are stored in memory or on disk (e.g., booleans, integers, numeric (real-valued), character, pointer (address, reference).\n\npointers: references to other locations (addresses) in memory. One often uses pointers to avoid unnecessary copying of data.\nhashes: hashing involves fast lookup of the value associated with a key (a label), using a hash function, which allows one to convert the key to an address. This avoids having to find the value associated with a specific key by looking through all the keys until the key of interest is found (an O(n) operation)."

Include who, when, what, how the code fits within a larger program (if appropriate), possibly the versions of R and key packages that you used.\nIndentation: do this systematically (your editor can help here). This helps you and others to read and understand the code and can help in detecting errors in your code because it can expose lack of symmetry.\nWhitespace: use a lot of it. Some places where it is good to have it are\n\naround operators (assignment and arithmetic);\nbetween function arguments;\nbetween list elements; and\nbetween matrix/array indices, in particular for missing indices.\n\nUse blank lines to separate blocks of code and comments to say what the block does\nSplit long lines at meaningful places.\nUse parentheses for clarity even if not needed for order of operations. For example, a/y*x will work but is not easy to read and you can easily induce a bug if you forget the order of ops.\nDocumentation - add lots of comments (but don’t belabor the obvious). Remember that in a few months, you may not follow your own code any better than a stranger. Some key things to document: (1) summarizing a block of code, (2) explaining a very complicated piece of code - recall our complicated regular expressions, (3) explaining arbitrary constant values.\nFor software development, break code into separate files (2000-3000 lines per file) with meaningful file names and related functions grouped within a file.\nChoose a consistent naming style for objects and functions: e.g. nIts vs. n.its vs numberOfIts vs. n_its\n\nThis R journal article summarizes the state of naming styles on CRAN.\nIn object-oriented languages such as Python and Java, periods are used in the context of object-oriented programming, so I recommend not using periods in the names of your objects.\n\nTry to have the names be informative without being overly long.\nDon’t overwrite names of objects/functions that already exist in R. E.g., don’t use ‘lm’. That said, the namespace system helps with the unavoidable cases where there are name conflicts.\nUse active names for functions (e.g., calcLogLik, calc_logLik rather than logLik or logLikCalc). The idea is that a function in a programming language is like a verb in regular language (a function does something), so use a verb in naming it.\nLearn from others’ code\n\nThis semester, someone will be reading your code - the GSI and and me when we look at your assignments. So to help us in understanding your code and develop good habits, put these ideas into practice in your assignments."

Why? Functions allow us to reuse blocks of code easily for later use and for recreating an analysis (reproducible research). It’s more transparent than sourcing a file of code because the inputs and outputs are specified formally, so you don’t have to read through the code to figure out what it does.\nFunctions should:\n\nbe modular (having a single task);\nhave meaningful name; and\nhave a comment describing their purpose, inputs and outputs (see the help file for an R function of your choice for how this is done in that context).\n\nWrite tests for each function (i.e., unit tests)\nDon’t hard code numbers - use variables (e.g., number of iterations, parameter values in simulations), even if you don’t expect to change the value, as this makes the code more readable. For example, the speed of light is a constant in a scientific sense, but best to make it a variable in code: speedOfLight <- 3e8\nUse R lists to keep disparate parts of related data together\nPractice defensive programming (see also the discussion below on assertions)\n\ncheck function inputs and warn users if the code will do something they might not expect or makes particular choices;\ncheck inputs to if and the ranges in for loops:\n\nuse seq_len() and seq_along() instead of 1:n in setting up for loops\nuse if(isTRUE(condition)) in if statements in case the condition is NA (which would otherwise cause an error)\n\nprovide reasonable default arguments;\ndocument the range of valid inputs;\ncheck that the output produced is valid; and\nstop execution based on checks and give an informative error message.\n\nTry to avoid system-dependent code that only runs on a specific version of an OS or specific OS\nLearn from others’ code\nConsider rewriting your code once you know all the settings and conditions; often analyses and projects meander as we do our work and the initial plan for the code no longer makes sense and the code is no longer designed specifically for the job being done."

In addition to simple use of stopifnot() and using if() combined with stop() and warning(), the assertthat and assertr packages provide useful tools. The checkmate package specifically helps in checking arguments.\nTests evaluate whether your code operates correctly. This can include tests that your code provides correct and useful errors when something goes wrong (so that means that a test might be to see if problematic input correctly produces an error). Unit tests are intended to test the behavior of small pieces (units) of code, generally individual functions. Unit tests naturally work well with the ideas above of writing small, modular functions. testthat and other packages are designed to make it easier to write sets of good tests.\nIn Lab 2, we’ll go over assertions and testing in detail."

Have data version numbers with a file describing the changes and dates (or in lab book). If possible, have all changes to data represented as code that processes the data relative to a fixed baseline dataset.\nNote what code files do what in the lab book.\nKeep track of the details of the system and software you are running your code under, e.g., operating system version, software (e.g., R, Python) versions, R or Python package versions, etc.\n\nIn R, sessionInfo() will report all this for you."

Alternatively, one can use the make tool, which is generally used for compiling code, as a tool for reproducible research: if interested, see the tutorial on Using make for workflows or this Journal of Statistical Software article for more details.\nYou might organize your workflow as an R package as described in this article.\nPackage management:\n\nR: You can manage the versions of R packages (and dependent packages) used in your project using package management packages such as renv, checkpoint, and packrat.\nPython: You can manage the versions of Python packages (and dependent packages) used in your project using Conda environments (or virtualenvs).\n\nIf your project uses multiple pieces of software (e.g., not just R or Python), you can set up a reproducible environment using containers, of which Docker containers are the best known. These provide something that is like a lightweight virtual machine in which you can install exactly the software (and versions) you want and then share with others. Docker container images are a key building block of various tools such as GitHub Actions and the Binder project\nYou can manage the configuration of a project using the config package. This allows you to set configuration values that control how your code/workflow runs, thereby enabling you to run the workflow under different scenarios (e.g., different input datasets, different models, different model configurations, etc.)."
